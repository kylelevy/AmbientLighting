# AmbientLighting
I wanted to make ambient lighting for my bedroom such that the main colour on my computer is what my LED's are set to.

This program uses itertools, os, sys, time and flux_led. The code takes the median colour on the screen and converts it to a hex value. It then passes that information into flux_led which communicates the colour to the LEDs.,
